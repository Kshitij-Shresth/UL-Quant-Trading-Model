This project provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing stock momentum and risk using advanced data processing, clustering, and visualization techniques.  Momentum investing capitalizes on the continuation of existing price trends, where stocks that have performed well in the past are expected to continue performing well in the future. By identifying high-momentum stocks and their associated risk levels, this project provides actionable insights that can be leveraged by traders, investors, and portfolio managers to enhance decision-making processes.

# Key Financial Concepts

## Fama-French 5-Factor Model:

The Fama-French 5-factor model enhances the analysis by accounting for multiple sources of return, including market, size, value, profitability, and investment factors. Incorporating this model allows the project to contextualize momentum within broader market dynamics and adjust for factors that could influence returns beyond momentum alone.

### Implementation: 
By calculating rolling factor betas, the project captures the sensitivity of stocks to these factors over time. Shifting these betas forward aligns them with future returns, providing a forward-looking risk-adjusted view of stock performance.
